# IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers

Check the course [here](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/intellij/)

I found some good content [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tutorials/marco-codes-maven/multi-module-projects/) too.

## Chapter One
Installed and Configured IntelliJ

## Chapter Two

Reading the basic maven project files and checking structures:
- `pom.xml` for control of dependencies
- `External Libraries` with `JDK` and `maven-imports`
- the `main` and `test` folders with cloned structure

Creating in three different ways a `maven` project:
1. A new one (with an `archetype`)
2. From an Existing Source
3. From a Remote Version Control

### Detail:
- It's important to not check `always open a new project in the same window` because you'll never know when you need to compare the `new one` with the `old one`.

## Chapter Three

- Keep the Project Language Level aligned with the `SDK` version
- Soft Wrap is really util for low-size in screen.
- Basically all the `main navigation bar` commands are present somewhere else in the `IDE`.

## Chapter Four

- `single click openning` file is util just when the `structure` menu is not showing.
-  Running `maven` from the maven menu...

## Chapter Five
Some util View Settings

## Chapter Six
- Creating `test methods`
- Creating `fileds and variables`
- Calling `methods` and checking `source code`
- etc...
## Chapter Seven
Learning to run tests, rerun, rerun only some, show/hide some, reading some error logs, pin and compare tests, etc...

## Chapter Eight

Run tests in `debug mode` to check the `memory states` of `variables` while the `compiled code` is `running` using `breakpoints`.

- Use the `evaluate` tool to check the results of using some `method`.

## Chapter Nine

Analysing code before using a Version Control System (like Git)

- Checked the `/java_course` with this tool and fixed *some* warnings.
- Menu `File -> Settings -> Editor -> Inspection` can be used to remove or put some inspection items when verifying your code, like `typos`.
- One that appears to be `very important` is the `Java Language level migration aids` to check compatibility issues...
- I'm running `SDK22`, so `lambda style declarations` should be replaced to run in a `JAVA 8` environment...


## Chapter Ten

Version Control Systems...

- There's a `git` submenu right-clicking in a `folder`, `package`, `class`, etc...
- I'm going to `commit` and `push` *now* from this `submenu` instead of using the `git bash`.

## Chapter Eleven

- Search Menu: `Classes`, `Files`, `Symbols`, `Actions`
- Local History: to check changes
- `TODO` and `javadoc` comment sections.

## Chapter Twelve

- IDE `major` and `minor` updates.
