### Chapter One
Installed and Configured IntelliJ

## Chapter Two

Reading the basic maven project files and checking structures:
- `pom.xml` for control of dependencies
- `External Libraries` with `JDK` and `maven-imports`
- the `main` and `test` folders with cloned structure

Creating in three different ways a `maven` project:
1. A new one (with an `archetype`)
2. From an Existing Source
3. From a Remote Version Control

Detail:
- It's important to not check `always open a new project in the same window` because you'll never know when you need to compare the `new one` with the `old one`.
