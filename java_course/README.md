## Java Course - Test Automation University

I'm doing this [Java course](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/java-programming-course/) to learn about java (you don't say?!)

## Chapter One

Installing JDK (used 22) and IntelliJ.

## Chapter Two

First simple scripts.

- a big price to say hello: `static void main (String args[]){}` is something big and new as `System.out.prinln()`.
- Simple scripts using `out.println`, `out.printf`, `util.Scanner`
  remembering to `scanner.close()` after using.

- Used and checked a bit about the implementation of primitive types:

  `int`, `string`, `double`, `float`.

- Checked `if` and `else` conditions and some logical operators
  `==`, `.equals()`, `||` && `&&` (lol).

## Chapter Three
Loopings... When to use:
- `if` when there's only one path
- `if, else` when there are two paths, but one condition to check
- `if + (else if)'s` to execute the code in the `first` condition reached in the sequence
- `switch` to test cases when a condition is checking only euqality `==`... don't forget to use a `break` to close the loop, and a `default` to catch any issues at the end of the cases!

I also checked a bit more about `Double` documentation... never let the user put a  greater than `Double.MAX_VALUE` or less than `Double.MIN_VALUE`... it's hard, I tried in my code, it's waaaay bigger in Java than in JS, lol

I also didn't use `nested if's` when teached, because I don't like nested if's. Instead, I used separated if's with Logical Operators...
Which were mentioned in the last part of this chapter..
