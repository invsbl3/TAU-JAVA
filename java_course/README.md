## Java Course - Test Automation University

I'm doing this [Java course](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/java-programming-course/) to learn about java (you don't say?!)

## Chapter One

Installing JDK (used 22) and IntelliJ.

### Chapter Two

First simple scripts.

- a big price to say hello: `static void main (String args[]){}` is something big and new as `System.out.prinln()`.
- Simple scripts using `out.println`, `out.printf`, `util.Scanner`
  remembering to `scanner.close()` after using.

- Used and checked a bit about the implementation of primitive types:

  `int`, `string`, `double`, `float`.

- Checked `if` and `else` conditions and some logical operators
  `==`, `.equals()`, `||` && `&&` (lol).
